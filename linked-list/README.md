# Singly Linked List
A singly linked list is a type of linked list that is unidirectional, that is, it can be traversed in only one direction from head to the last node (tail).

## Challenge
cerate Node.java 
cerate linkedlist.java
cerate App.java


## Approach & Efficiency
#### Big O:
* o(1)
* o(n)

## API
1. insert : Adds a new node with that value to the head of the list with an O(1) Time performance.
2. includes : Indicates whether that value exists as a Nodeâ€™s value somewhere within the list.
3. to string:Returns: a string representing all the values in the Linked List, formatted as:
"{ a } -> { b } -> { c } -> NULL"
# Challenge Summary
Write the following methods for the Linked List class:

1. append add value at last node
arguments: new value
adds a new node with the given value to the end of the list
2. insert before :add value before node
arguments: value, new value
adds a new node with the given new value immediately before the first node that has the value specified
3. insert after :add value after node
arguments: value, new value
adds a new node with the given new value immediately after the first node that has the value specified
